We want a blogging system that:
- scalable
- easy to use
- customizable
- secure

 Things I like about cloudcannon and Jekyll
 - cheap
 - fast
 - malleable
 - easy
 - can do everything blogger does but better
 - Versioning

 why not wordpress
 - challenging (PHP is a deep dark whole)
 - expensive
 - security issues (plugins and software to update)

 Features I want
 - customizable layouts
 - editable from the frontend
 - Fitvid.js

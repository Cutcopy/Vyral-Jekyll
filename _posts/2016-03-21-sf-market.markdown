**Are we currently in a buyer's or seller's market?** This is the question on everyone's mind, and today we'll answer it.

It’s a pretty balanced market right now, but in most areas seller’s have a slight advantage. This time of year, inventory is typically quite low, so **what we’re seeing now is pretty normal**. You can expect to see more listings pop up in the early spring months.

Our market is pretty balanced for now, but we’re unsure how much longer it will last.</div>

When inventory is low, home prices don’t fall. Right now, they are pretty stable in our area, which is good news for buyers. Also, interest rates are still quite low despite a slight hike in December. **This is great for buyers looking to make their dollar go further!**

Whether you’re buying or selling, there are a lot of great opportunities in our current market. **Conditions aren’t always this steady**, and we may see some changes for the worse if interest rates rise like they’re expected to. In short, now is a great time to make a move!

If you have any questions about our current market, or if you would like real estate assistance of any kind, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!
